# MakeMoreTime  
Money is not evil by itself  

Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways  

If not money – what is evil you may ask?  

Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more  

Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold  

at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist  

Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost  

Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again  

until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone  

Make more time  

I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful  

I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success  

Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling  

You can change today if you redefine what success is to you  

You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones  

You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you  

You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like  

You can re-balance your priorities in life  

You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible  

You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86  

but don’t wait until then…  

You will always be able to make more money  

But you cannot make more time
